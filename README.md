# REPLjs

REPLjs is a JavaScript Read-Eval-Print-Loop React Native application. Users type ES6 JavaScript, and the app executes it in a sandboxed environment. It then displays the tokenized and styled code input followed by styled console outputs from the sandboxed execution.

**This is a React Native project of mine from circa 2015-2016 that has not been updated since that time and as such DOES NOT RUN. It did run once, but my busty schedule drew me away while React Native marched onwards. It needs some updating to function again, so for now it's just a memory and this code.**

This is not the original repo, as I started a fresh React Native project and copied over my core components hoping it would be an easy process to recreate the app. It was not, and recreating this app is not a high priority for me at this time.
